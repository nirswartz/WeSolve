        <h2>
          Why <span class="aladin">WeSolve</span>?
        </h2>
        <p>
          As university students during COVID-19, creating study groups for exams became more difficult since students were not physically in the campus, so making new connections with other students was hard.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="aladin">WeSolve</span> intends to fill this gap and make the studying experience a little bit more social and cooperative.
